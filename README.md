## StretchyTabs

A fork of ElasticTabstops by Justin Dailey (https://github.com/dail8859/ElasticTabstops) version 1.4 created because behavioural changes in the official 1.5 version developed by Marius Vasiliu (https://github.com/mariusv-github/ElasticTabstops) don't match my personal preferences.

This version, as well as reverting these changes, introduces a minimum length for tabs and introduces an increased window for matching tabs so that tabs in blocks containing a mixed number of tabs will align with each other.
